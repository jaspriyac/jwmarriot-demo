<div class="fc">
<h2>Face Coverings</h2>
<p> Providing a safer environment for our guests and associates is a top priority.
<br><br>For the U.S. - fully vaccinated guests are no longer required to wear face coverings or social distance in indoor or outdoor areas of the hotel, unless required by local law. All unvaccinated Associates are required to wear face coverings when indoors.
<br><br>For Canada, face coverings are optional for guests in jurisdictions where face coverings are not required to be worn indoors. All associates in Canada will continue to be required to wear face coverings.
<br><br>For Caribbean and Latin America, face coverings are required for guests and associates in all indoor public areas.</p>

<p>
<font face="Arial">In public spaces, the company has added to its already rigorous cleaning protocols,
<br>requiring that surfaces are treated with hospital-grade disinfectants and that this
<br>cleaning is done with increased frequency. In guest rooms, Marriott has added to its
<br>detailed cleaning practices, requiring all surfaces to be thoroughly cleaned with
<br>hospital-grade disinfectants. In the US, wipes will be available upon guest request at
<br>the front desk. </font></p>
<p>
 <font face="Arial">These new enhanced cleaning technologies including electrostatic sprayers to
<br>sanitize surfaces throughout the hotel. We are using air purifying systems that are
<br>effective against viruses in the air and on surfaces. Learn more about our partnership

<p>
<font face="Arial">To help alleviate the risk of COVID-19 transmission through person-to-person
<br>contact, Marriott will be using signage in its lobbies to remind guests to maintain
<br>social distancing protocols and will remove or re-arrange furniture to allow more
<br>space for distancing. The company is planning to add partitions at front desks to
<br>provide an extra level of precaution for its guests and associates and is working with
<br>supply chain partners to make masks and gloves available to associates. You'll see
<br>more hand sanitizing stations around Marriott's hotels - near the entrances and front
<br>desks, elevator banks and fitness and meeting spaces.</font></p></td>

<br>conduct self-inspection using its food safety standards as guidelines, and
<br>compliance is validated by independent audits. Marriott is also enhancing sanitation
<br>guidelines and training videos for associates that include hygiene and disinfecting
<br>practices. In addition, the company is modifying its operational practices for in-room
